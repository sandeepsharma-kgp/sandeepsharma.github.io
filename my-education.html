<p>
Education is one of the most important aspects in my life. I work my hardest during school so that I am successful when I grow up. My goal is to be a researcher and to reach that goal I need proper schooling. I feel as though my education is what keeps me on the right track. I have ambition to get to institute like IITs one day and this ambition helps me stay focused and do well in school. I know that the more education you have the better your career will be so I feel that working very hard right now will most definitely pay off in the long run. With education I will be the hardworking man I was destined to be.

My goals in life are all based around a good, well-earned education. When I grow up I aspire to have a B.Tech in IIT. This will lead me onto my career of being a good engineer and help me reach my goals of being successful. It is true that as I am within my career I will never stop my education. I will always continue to take class . My education is one of the most important things I need to succeed.
