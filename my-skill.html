Throughout my experience at high school I have learned and expanded my knowledge on many different subjects. This ranges anywhere from maths and science,to English and history- but where I have learned the most is in computers and technology. I have broaden my horizons when it comes to learning about software programs and the millions of free useful resources you can find on the internet.
